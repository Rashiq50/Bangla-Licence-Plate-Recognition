Here we have discussed MSER region based text detection used in Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR). Automatic
recognition of car license plates plays an important role in traffic surveillance systems. Such system which is applied in parking
areas, highways, bridges and tunnels, can help a human operator and improve overall quality ofa service. Text detection is a process
of localizing various regions and helps in removing the non-text regions and extraction of the required text. MSER region based
detection is mainly for detecting the text and which eliminates the non-text region making it efficient for following steps in
ALPR(segmentation and recognition). MSER detects near about 2600 regions for image and gives greater results in region size, blur,
viewpoint change, scale change and light changes. The method which detects the character with high percentage accuracy is used
for text detection.
